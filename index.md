## Introductory Blog - January 10, 2020
#### About Me
##### My name is **Sydney Jackson**. I'm a senior Computer Information Systems major.
I'm 22 years old. I'm from Bonneau, South Carolina where I graduated as Valedictorian from Timberland High School. <br />
I currently live in Mount Pleasant. <br />
In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, archery hunting, competitive activities, and finding ways to better myself.
#### Future
Right now, I am actively searching for an internship that I can complete when I graduate in May. <br />
I'm undecided on what I want to focus on for a long-term career. <br />
I would prefer to stay in the Charleston or surrounding areas, however moving for a job is not off the table either. <br /> <br />
I know that the company that hires me will be lucky to have a hired someone with a great work ethic and an open-mind.
