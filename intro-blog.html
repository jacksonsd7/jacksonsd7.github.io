My name is Sydney Jackson.
I'm a senior & a Computer Information Systems major.
I'm 22, from Bonneau, South Carolina where I graduated as Valedictorian from Timberland High School.
I currently live in Mount Pleasant.

Right now, I am actively searching for an internship that I can complete when I graduate in May.
I'm undecided on what I want to focus on for a long-term career.
I would prefer to stay in the Charleston or surrounding areas, however moving for a job is not off the table either.
I know that the company that hires me will be lucky to have a hired someone with a great work ethic and an open-mind.
